<h1>Tribute to the Cross</h1>
<p>In shadows cast on rugged wood, it stands,<br>
A symbol of redemption, <em>love's</em> demand.<br>
The cross, a bridge 'twixt heaven and this Earth,<br>
Where grace and sacrifice found wondrous birth.<br>
Its arms outstretched, a sacred, solemn sign,<br>
Of hope and faith in <strong>God's</strong> design.<br>
A symbol of the burdens that we bear,<br>
And in its grace, we find salvation's air.<br>
A symbol of a love beyond compare,<br>
<strong>The cross, a testament to <em>endless</em> care.</strong></p>
